# Predicting-Handwritten-Digits-PCA-
# 🧠 Income Prediction with Machine Learning (Digits Dataset)

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict income categories using **numerical features** from the `digits.xlsx` dataset.  
It involves preprocessing, training, and evaluating classification models to make accurate predictions.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.  
Install required libraries with:

## Dependencies:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

jupyter

openpyxl (for reading .xlsx files)

## Steps Performed

Data Loading

Imported digits.xlsx using pandas.read_excel().

Checked data shape, column names, and null values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions and correlations between features.

Identified patterns relevant to income classification.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing or inconsistent values.

Scaled features where needed.

Split dataset into training and test sets.

Model Training

Applied machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation

Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualized results with confusion matrix and performance graphs.

Prediction

Used the best model to predict income categories for unseen data.

## 📈 Results

Achieved strong classification accuracy using numeric predictors.

Identified the most impactful numeric features for income prediction.

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook

Clone this repository or download the files.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Open Predicting Income -checkpoint.ipynb.

Run the cells step by step.

Ensure digits.xlsx is in the same folder as the notebook.

## 🧭 Future Work

Experiment with advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).

Add automated feature selection.

Deploy the model with a simple UI or API.
